# Preceptions Of Fear Within The American Population when walking alone at night

## Overview

This research examines the evolving perceptions of safety among Americans when walking alone at night, a topic with significant implications for overall well-being, urban planning, and policymaking. Leveraging data from the renowned General Social Survey (GSS) conducted by the University of Chicago's NORC, spanning from 1973 to 2022, the study aims to uncover trends and potential disparities in perceived safety among different demographic groups over time. By analyzing factors such as age, health, racial identity, and gender, the research explores the interplay between these variables and their influence on individuals' sense of security when engaging in this routine activity. Understanding the nuances of these perceptions is crucial for informing efforts to create inclusive environments where all citizens feel safe and empowered to navigate their surroundings without fear.
